# Tic-Tac-Toe

An implementation of the famous game "Tic-Tac-Toe", refactored from Ruby, now built using Vue3.js running on Vite.

This project utilizes the "new" Composition API, a feature of Vue3.js. It served as a way for me to learn this new feature.

## TODO

Implement history feature, make board size dynamic
